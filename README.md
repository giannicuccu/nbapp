# Neighborhood Map Project
This is a basic implementation of React Neighborhood Map App for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The App displays a list of locations in Rome and a map with relative markers and infoWindows.
By clicking on infoWindows links additional data are fetched from Wikipedia trough Wikimedia API and presented to te user in a side panel.
